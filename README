This is very much a POC for an XFCE-style window pager.  It's also my first C program so I don't know what I'm doing.
All the configuration is hardcoded right now, but it should be mostly obvious

Installation
- Update the hardcoded path to window-data.sh in main.c to the absolute location on your system.  I'll fix this eventually
- Run `make`
- Execute `pager` or hook it up to your window manager

Dependencies
- X11 (obviously)
- Xft and freetype2 (likely installed)
- xdotool (commands to the window manager, window geometry querying)
- xprop (get the list of virtual desktop names, get stacking list of window IDs)
- bash, sed, awk, cut (string manipulation of xdotool and xprop)

Limitations
- Loading data could technically be done in the C code, but I hate C strings and wanted to do as little string processing as possible.
- The window set is statically loaded once.  This means no window moving/new windows/window closing will be tracked. 
- Filtering limited to alphanumeric characters until I figure out how unicode keylogging works.
- Number of desktops is statically defined.  Max number of windows is statically defined.
  I don't have a dynamic array implementation and didn't want to get more frustrated with this language.
- Currently relies on _NET_CLIENT_LIST_STACKING to determine which windows are above others. Pretty sure this is wrong

Compromises
- Had to use Xft.h in order to support UTF8 strings for workspace names (glyph/icon fonts).
  This means depending on both the xft libs and the freetype2 fonts.  You __probably__ have these installed anyway.
- Some inefficient pieces of code where associate arrays or tries would come in handy.  I don't know how to do these in C.

Additional Notes
- The UTF8 decoding was copied from another repository (TODO: find that link...)
